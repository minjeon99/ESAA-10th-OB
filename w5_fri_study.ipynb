                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n32

uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

the seats a very supportive .\\n37

   Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm .\\n39

                                       We could not have been more pleased with the service, location, as well as the room and its view .\\n84

      On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services .\\n85

  In my eyes that is a step up from stealing because we did not utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center .\\n86

             Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large

                                          The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

the seats a very supportive .\\n37

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer

and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly

                                                 You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

   Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into

                                                The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93

road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

            Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature,

great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6,

getting 5 mpg less then 06 Accord .\\n132

life, but I've only charged it once and that was on the computer  as far as I've seen my computer doen't charge well with either of my iPods so the battery life is possibly greater than I thought if

                    On the 750 the zoom buttons are on opposite sides of the screen .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                   The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .\\n3                                                                Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

time .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi 255W is the right choice .\\n8                                                                                                                    One of my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9

Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12

                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16

valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

                                      I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed

                                So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75

                                                                                                            Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79

.\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82

I understand what the verbal instructions were .\\n84                                                                                                                                                3

                                   After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92

           The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                  We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n95

now it is fast and reliable .\\n109                                                                                                                                                                                                          Boot up of the Operating System is slower in the RTM for whatever reason but on newer hardware it is pretty fast .\\n110

will be slower going in but I am very happy with the operating system .\\n111

a bunch of legacy files hanging around to slow down Win7 so I reformatted the HD before doing the Win7 install .\\n113

                                                                                                                                                                                    It takes a little work to setup and doesn't run you application as fast as they would natively .\\n116

destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n33

this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    The closest one that gives the most accurate route that I usually take is the Navigon .\\n40

good food .\\n8

                              They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .\\n11

something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

                                                   The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

          For self catering types, Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon

cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23

degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26

need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

                        As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger

                                         If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43

pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45

                                                          Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48

true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located

The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54

buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

                     Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

things I would not buy if I had to pay full price .\\n75

                                          99, thus offsetting the high price of the Kindle .\\n77                                                                                                                                                             Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the new releases .\\n78

cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n176

                             The wine tasting in the afternoon made available from the manager was a really nice touch as was the free tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning which got you off to a great start for the day .\\n58

        Nothing disappointed us about our stay and we didn\\u0092t even take advantage of the free wine tasting between 5, 6pm .\\n61

      Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n65

thus having a cheap breakfast .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                 We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n67

that are part of the hotel .\\n70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\n71

but the fee is not out of line .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                   There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75

free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .\\n77

assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n29

service was outstanding .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                       Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36

his services .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The food and service were both excellent .\\n38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45

                                                                                                        We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

                                                                                                                                                                                          The concierge service is second to none .\\n49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50

service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                        The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                             I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                      Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57

                                                   The service in the hotel was really good .\\n59                                                                                                                                                     The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61                                                                                                                           However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                   We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .\\n63                                                                                                                      We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

                                           If you have the first Kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26

                  To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

                                             The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

     Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53

.\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55

a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

down .\\n59

significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

obviously out of my price range .\\n64

                                                                                                                                                                                        Last I would suggest for the price a protective cover should be included with the product .\\n66

.\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                I checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the Kindle Editions .\\n68

while others were much cheaper for the Kindle .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                      she thought she wanted one, but was a bit daunted by the price and the question of how much she would actually use it .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                   I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .\\n71

my opinion .\\n72

Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          I can download samples and buy books for $10 so I have a lot of things I would not buy if I had to pay full price .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Books are priced in US$ for oversea consumers .\\n76

of the Kindle .\\n77                                                                                                                                                             Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the new releases .\\n78

               I had been wanting a Kindle but had balked at getting one because of the price, but after our last move and packing up all of our books, and giving many away I was more open to the idea

                                              Reading is something that I absolutely love, but I find it hard to wait several days for a book to be shipped to me or pay the outrageous prices at a

    With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

.\\n34

getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37

dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

                                Every K2 button has a satisfying \\n42                                                                                                                                       Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .\\n46

impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                              Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The  next page  buttons should activate when pressed at any angle .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can pretty much figure everything out by just trying the buttons .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The keyboard buttons are small, round, low, profile and have slightly convex tops .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                                      My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The welcome screen comes on to explain all the buttons .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             sym button depressed at same time\\n87                                                                                                                                                                 Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                        The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Buttons are not hard to press for me .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                      They do require a bit of pressure, but I like it that way so I can rest my thumbs on the buttons without turning the page accidentally .\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Getting a free sample wirelessly and then just hitting a button to buy it is great .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                   I hate tiny gadgets with tiny screens covered with tiny buttons that lead to a labyrinth of tiny submenus filled with nonsensical options .\\n98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Click a button and it's there in seconds .\\n99

                                                        My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book

Your finger can rest on the  next page  button, and a simple click is all you need to advance .\\n138

.\\n139                                                                                                                              I don't need two hands to hold the book open when I'm on the train, or whenever, just one hand gives you good access to all the buttons even while you are holding the device .\\n140                                                                                                                                                      I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to .\\n141                                                                                                                                                                     The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .\\n142

improvement over those odd keys on the K1 .\\n145                                                                                                                                                                                My only fear is that I will wear out my 5 direction menu button within the month,  since there is SO much to see, do and find\\n146                                                                                                                                                                       Just hit the enter button on the keyboard, and it takes you directly to the full dictionary entry, complete with pronunciation guide .\\n147                                                                                                                                                                                                       The buttons are placed in a convenient area without being in the way, yet turning a page is a breeze .\\n148                                                                                                                                                                                                      Previous button presses inward, toward the screen, while other buttons press toward the outside edges .\\n149

                        When I purchased the Kindle originally, I had several issues with the physical layout, the inability to stop the  accidental  button pushing and the sharp corners .\\n152                                                                                                                                                In the Kindle 2, the corners have been rounded and the buttons have been restructured so that it takes a little pressure to press inward instead of outward .\\n153

.\\n154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .\\n155

the bottom .\\n156                                                                                                                                                                                                                             On the Kindle 2, the button has been moved to the top right side of the device .\\n157

some pressure to activate .\\n158                                                                                                                                                What remains to be seen, however, is whether the Kindle 2 will be plagued with having to be reset as frequently as the Kindle, nor did I see a reset button .\\n159

page  button on both sides of the Kindle 2 .\\n160                                                                                                                                                     The buttons on the K2 are not easily pressed while reading, and I love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .\\n161

would flicker a bit when I hit a button, but that was all .\\n162

over to plug in the Kindle, and the phone rang before I straightened up .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
